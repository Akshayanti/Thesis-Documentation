\Title{Consistency of Linguistic Annotation}
\Keywords{Annotation Consistency \sep Annotation Inconsistency \sep Error Mining \sep Language Independent \sep Universal Dependencies \sep UD Project \sep Syntax \sep Morphology}
\Subject{This research attempts at identification and correction of inconsistencies in different treebanks. The inconsistencies might be related to linguistic constructions, failure of the guidelines of annotation, failure to understand the guidelines on annotator's part, or random errors caused by annotators, among others. The work also proposes a metric to test the similarity of different treebanks in the same language, when the annotation guidelines remain the same. We offer solutions to some previously identified inconsistencies in the scope of the Universal Dependencies Project in a language neutral manner, the solutions being reliable enough to not need a human annotator in the pipeline.}
